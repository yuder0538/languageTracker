**A cloneable workflow layer that stops AI coding agents from shipping non-trivial changes based on vague requirements.**

Copy this repo into any project. Claude Code, Codex, and other agentic tools
then follow the same gated process — spec, plan, task cards, implementation,
verification, review — before code reaches production.

## Preview

The kit ships a local, zero-dependency Kanban board (`tools/kanban/`, `npm run kanban`)
that visualizes every task's progress through the gates below.

## The Problem

- Agents start coding from vague prompts and produce large, unreviewable diffs.
- "Looks right" ships without tests, screenshots, or evidence.
- Architecture and security get reviewed after the code is already written, if at all.
- Every project reinvents its own ad-hoc process for working with agents.

## How It Works

Every non-trivial change moves through these phases, defined in full in
`ai/process/workflow.md`:

| Phase | Output | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0. Intake | Problem statement, goal, constraints, unknowns | Vague request -> go to Clarification |
| 1. Context Discovery | Task-specific context pack: files, patterns, risks, verification commands | — |
| 2. Clarification | `feature-spec.md`, non-goals, acceptance criteria | Human approval |
| 3. UI Mockup *(if UI)* | Screen/state maps, 2-3 variants, trade-offs | Human picks a variant |
| 4. Architecture Plan | Files touched, data/API contracts, rollback plan | High-risk -> architect + security + test review |
| 5. Task Cards | AI-ready cards meeting `definition-of-ready.md` | — |
| 6. Implementation | One approved card at a time, small diffs | Scope change -> stop and ask |
| 7. Verification | Tests, typecheck, lint, build, security scan, screenshots | — |
| 8. Review | Product / UX / architecture / security / test / code review | `review-gates.md` |
| 9. Human Acceptance | What changed, evidence, residual risk, follow-ups | No evidence -> not done |

New project with no Epic/User Story backlog yet? Run the `project-kickoff`
skill first — it splits the project into Epics -> User Stories -> Tasks and
seeds `tools/kanban/`.

## Design Quality: Two Layers

UI work is governed by two complementary layers — process alone produces
compliant-but-ugly screens, so the kit ships both:

1. **Design system (what to use)** — Epic 0 builds the design system in five
   human-gated stages (framework -> style direction -> design tokens ->
   component library -> page layouts), persisted to
   `ai/context/design-system.md`. Every later UI task must reuse those
   tokens/components; missing components are built in the same style and
   registered back into the inventory.
2. **Design craft (how to make it good)** — `ai/skills/design-craft.md`
   carries the visual-quality discipline (Refactoring UI principles, type
   scale, 4px spacing grid, layered color systems, depth rules, five
   interactive states) plus a curated list of high-quality open-source
   references to compare against before designing. Deliverables are checked
   against `ai/checklists/design-review-checklist.md`.

Both live in the repository, so every machine and every agent (Claude Code,
Codex, ...) that clones the repo gets the same design standard — no hidden
dependency on skills installed in someone's home directory.

## Rules Enforced On Every Agent

From `AGENTS.md`, read before any agent touches this repository:

- No non-trivial change from a vague request.
- Start from context discovery, not assumptions.
- `definition-of-ready.md` before implementation, `definition-of-done.md` before calling anything done.
- UI changes need `screen-spec.md` + `mockup-decision.md`, reuse the design system in `ai/context/design-system.md`, and follow the `design-craft` visual discipline.
- High-risk changes need architecture + security + test review.
- Reuse existing patterns over new abstractions.
- Stay inside the approved task card's scope; no unrelated file changes without saying so.
- No completion claim without evidence: commands, output, screenshots, residual risk.

Agent output is never itself an approval — humans sign off at every gate in
`ai/process/review-gates.md`.

## What This Replaces

| Inspiration | Borrowed idea |
| --- | --- |
| BMAD Method | Role-based AI agile workflows |
| GitHub Spec Kit | Spec-first: clarify -> plan -> tasks -> implement |
| Kiro Specs | Requirements, design, and task artifacts |
| Task Master | PRD-to-task decomposition, model routing |
| Serena | Semantic project search and context retrieval |
| SuperClaude | Slash-command style repeatable workflows |
| Archon | Deterministic, gate-based workflow execution |
| Plandex | Large-context planning, diff review, controlled execution |
| CodeRabbit / Qodo | Review-first quality gates |

Not vendored — this kit is a process layer that can call or coexist with any
of them.

```

## Quick Start

**Starting a new project?** Clone this repo and build directly inside it —
`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the whole `ai/` toolkit are already at the root.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pjwang2022/Monstrare.git my-project
cd my-project
rm -rf .git && git init   # start your own history
```

Then make it yours: replace `README.md`/`README.zh-TW.md` with your own
project's readme, rename `package.json`'s `name`, and optionally delete
`scripts/install-into-project.sh` and the board-design history under
`tools/kanban/` (`mockups/`, `mockup-decision.md`, `screen-spec.md`) — those
belong to Monstrare itself, not your project.

Then open Claude Code or Codex in that folder and just describe what you want
to build:

```bash
claude
```

```text
I want to build an online booking system.
```

Since there's no Epic/User Story backlog yet, this triggers the
`project-kickoff` skill: it breaks the idea into Epics -> User Stories ->
Tasks and seeds `tools/kanban/`. Each task then walks through the phases in
[How It Works](#how-it-works) on its own.

**Adding this to an existing codebase instead?** Skip to
[Install Into An Existing Project](#install-into-an-existing-project) below,
then start from context discovery instead of `project-kickoff`:

```text
Use the project-search skill to create ai/context/project-map.md and ai/context/code-search-guide.md.
Do not implement anything yet.
```

```text
Use spec-interrogation for: <feature idea>.
Create a feature spec, screen specs if UI is involved, and AI-ready task cards.
Stop before implementation for human review.
```

## Install Into An Existing Project

```bash
scripts/install-into-project.sh /path/to/your/project
```

Copies process files, templates, checklists, Claude/Codex skills and agents,
the governance self-check, GitHub PR/issue templates, and the kanban tool
(minus Monstrare's own board-design history) into the target project.

Never overwritten: existing `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ai/context/` files,
`ai/artifacts/`, `.codex/config.toml`, and an existing `tools/kanban/`.
Always updated to the kit's latest version: `ai/process/`, `ai/templates/`,
`ai/checklists/`, `ai/skills/`, and the skill stubs — if you've locally
modified those kit files, commit before re-running the installer.

```bash
scripts/check-governance.sh   # self-check from the repo root
```

## AI Kanban

`ai/process/kanban.md` is the board policy — it tracks whether a task is
ready for safe agent execution, not just its status. `tools/kanban/` is one
implementation of it: a zero-dependency local board that simplifies the
policy's 12 stages down to 6 lanes (Backlog -> Blocked -> Ready ->
Implementing -> Verify -> Done). The tool is optional; the policy doesn't
require it.

```bash
npm run kanban   # open http://127.0.0.1:4420
```

![Kanban board](tools/kanban/docs/board-screenshot.png)

- **Add a card** — click "+ 新增卡片" at the bottom of any lane; the server assigns the ID.
- **Move a card** — drag it into another lane to change its stage, or reorder it within a lane.
- **Edit details** — click a card to open its panel: owner, risk, agent, Readiness checklist, Review Gates, comments.
- **Track by Epic/User Story** — switch to the "藍圖" (Roadmap) tab.

Every action writes straight back to `cards/*.json` — no save button, no
database; `git commit`/`git push` is how state is persisted and shared. Full
schema and API reference: [`tools/kanban/README.md`](tools/kanban/README.md).
